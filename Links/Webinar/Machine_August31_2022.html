                    <b>Abstract</b>
                    <p>Machine learning (ML) concepts have been discussed in academia and industry since the 1950s, but have only seen real-world application during the last few decades. Recent improvements in enabling technologies â€“computing speeds, data storage costs, and algorithm design-- have made ML applications more relevant. The last decade has seen substantial ML interest from the power systems community in particular, as power systems data, generation intermittency, and the need for more sophisticated optimization have grown. These developments present opportunities to improve several facets of grid operation reliability and security, from cyber security to operator situational awareness. This talk will present these opportunities of using ML to forecast operations of energy storage resources and crypto loads.
