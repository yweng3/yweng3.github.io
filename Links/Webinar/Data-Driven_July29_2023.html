                    <b>Abstract</b>
                    <p>Power systems evolution is driven by decarbonization, decentralization and digitalization. Focusing on the last one, data acquired by smart metering and sensing devices offers a huge potential to enhance monitoring, operation, planning, maintenance processes. Artificial intelligence techniques can help extracting value from this data and lead to services including generation forecasting, demand forecasting, flexibility forecasting, topology estimation, grid observability, non-technical losses estimation, assets predictive maintenance. This tutorial will examine them, with special focus on data-driven solutions for distrbution grids being developed in the context of BD4OPEM H2020 project.

                        <b>Q & A</b>
                        <p><strong>Q</strong>: I am working on topology array in distribution systems. The topology of low voltage distribution networks (like 400 volts) is hard to be detected since the measurement is mainly at end users (customer meters). Any suggestions for researchers on topology recovery research? How do you detect topology for secondary distribution networks using AI-based methods?<br>
<strong>Q</strong>: In the predictive maintenance slide, I feel the innovation may most probably come from manufacturers rather than plant operators. How far is it from theory to application in predictive maintenance? Is there an application example? Should it benefit or need to have data from sensors monitoring the asset if you want to be able to detect when a failure would happen?<br>
<strong>A</strong>: For the services in our project related to predicting when something like a transformer could fail, a problem we encounter is that sometimes there isn't enough historical data reflecting previous failures. Without that, it's impossible to develop a recognition model or a model that allows predicting future failures. So, it's important for the industry to deploy appropriate devices to monitor relevant signals that would indicate failure. This is beneficial for both manufacturers (as they can sell more sophisticated products) and for distribution system operators (as they can have more insights into what could happen in the asset and when it might fail).<br>
