                    <b>Abstract</b>
                    <p>Recent years have seen a dramatic growth of smart sensors in power distribution grids. The new sensing capabilities, offered by smart meters, micro-phasor measurement units, and SCADA, have extended utilities’ visibility to grid edges. In 2019, we have delivered an IEEE BDA tutorial on “Mining Smart Meter Data for Improving Distribution Grid Operation and Resilience,” where we introduced the work of using smart meter data to estimate load profiles and cold load pick-up effects. This talk will introduce our continuous efforts on extracting useful and actionable information from distribution grid data. We will present three use cases. The first one is using smart meter data and a customized physics-inspired neural network to estimate secondary distribution grid voltages, thus, facilitating the solar hosting capacity analysis. The second one is using smart meter data and random forest classifier to detect the presence of electric vehicle charging. The third one is using SCADA data for measurement and verification (M&V) of the energy saving effect of conservation voltage reduction (CVR). The work is based on a recently approved IEEE Standard P3102 CVR Data Collection and Management Procedures.
