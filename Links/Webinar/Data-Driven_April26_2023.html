                    <p>Enrico Zio received the MSc degree in nuclear engineering from Politecnico di Milano in 1991 and in mechanical engineering from UCLA in 1995, and the Ph.D. degree in nuclear engineering from Politecnico di Milano and in probabilistic risk assessment at MIT in 1996 and 1998, respectively. He is currently full professor at the Centre for research on Risk and Crises (CRC) of Ecole de Mines, Paris, PSL University, France, full professor and President of the Alumni Association at Politecnico di Milano, Italy, distinguished guest professor at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, adjunct professor at City University of Hong Kong, Beihang University and Wuhan University, China and Co-Director of the Center for REliability and Safety of Critical Infrastructures (CRESCI) and the sino-french laboratory of Risk Science and Engineering (RISE), at Beihang University, Beijing, China. </p> <p>He is IEEE and Sigma Xi Distinguished Lecturer. </p> <p>In 2020, he has been awarded the prestigious Humboldt Research Award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in Germany (https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/home.html), one the world's most prestigious research awards across all scientific disciplines. The Award is given to outstandingly qualified researchers and future leaders from science-related fields (but very seldom awarded to engineers!). The Award is granted in recognition of a researcher's entire achievements to date, to academics whose fundamental discoveries, new theories, or insights have had a significant impact on their own discipline and who are expected to continue producing cutting-edge achievements in the future. Professor Zio has been selected for the Award in light of being a World leading scientist in Risk and Resilience Assessment, Safety Analysis and Reliability Engineering of complex systems and infrastructures, in particular for energy applications. He has been one of the pioneers in using artificial intelligence (such as neural networks) and genetic algorithms in reliability engineering and risk assessment, solving key problems related to the safety and reliability of critical systems such as those used in the nuclear, oil and gas, transportation industries. He has promoted the use of computational modeling within various international initiatives. </p> <p>His Google Scholar H-index is 93 and he is in the top 2% of the World scientists, according to Stanford ranking. </p> <p> In 2021, he has been appointed as: (1) Member of the Board Committee of the International Joint Research Center for Resilient Infrastructure (ICRI) 2021-2026, (2) 4TU.Resilience Ambassador by the 4TU Centre for Resilience Engineering and its backbone â€“ the 4TU- programme DeSIRE (Designing Systems for informed Resilience Engineering), a strategic capacity building research programme of the four Dutch Technical Universities, and (3) Fellow of the of the Prognostics & Health Management Society a world recognized scientist in the area of reliability centered, condition based and predictive maintenance. </p> <p>In 2023, he has been appointed as Scientific Director of Research and Development of Datrix AI Solutions group. </p> <p> His research focuses on the modeling of the failure-repair-maintenance behavior of components and complex systems, for the analysis of their reliability, maintainability, prognostics, safety, vulnerability, resilience and security characteristics, and on the development and use of Monte Carlo simulation methods, artificial intelligence techniques and optimization heuristics. He is author and co-author of seven books and more than 500 papers on international journals, Chairman and Co-Chairman of several international Conferences, associate editor of several international journals and referee of more than 20.

                    <b>Abstract</b>
                    <p>The increased knowledge, information and data (KID) available nowadays can improve our prediction capabilities, offering new ways for the reliable design and safe operation of energy components and systems. Particularly, the increased availability of data coming from monitoring the relevant parameters of components, systems and assets performance, and the grown ability of treating these data by intelligent machine learning algorithms, capable of mining out information relevant to the assessment and prediction of their functional state, have open wide the doors for improved design, operation and maintenance.<br>In this webinar, we look into this from the perspectives of data-driven Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) for the predictive maintenance of components and systems of the energy industry.
