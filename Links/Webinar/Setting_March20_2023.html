                    <b>Abstract</b>
                    <p>Exelon’s goal to become the utility of the future has led to a strategic initiative to accelerate our analytics maturity and culture, and empower employees to make data-driven decisions. As a result, the firstof- its-kind Analytics Academy was launched to upskill the organization to meet the future’s critical digital and insight-driven needs. The Academy provides a university experience, providing employees with coaching and mentoring, curated advanced analytics training, and connecting them with a vast community and network of analytic professionals and leaders applying analytics capabilities to solve high-priority business problems.
