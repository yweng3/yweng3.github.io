                    <p>Huai Wang is a Professor at the Department of Energy, Aalborg University in Denmark. He leads the Reliability of Power Electronic Converters (ReliaPEC) group and is the Mission Leader of Digital Transformation and AI at AAU Energy, with 13 affiliated research groups. His research addresses the fundamental challenges and application issues related to efficient, reliable, and cognitive power electronic converters. Dr. Wang actively collaborates with companies throughout the value chain, from power electronic materials and components to systems. He has initiated four short-term industrial/Ph.D. courses, which have been attended by over 500 Ph.D. students and industry engineers. In addition, he has delivered more than 30 tutorials and given over 100 invited talks. Dr. Wang received his Ph.D. degree from City University of Hong Kong in 2012 and B.E. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology. He has also conducted research as a short-term visiting scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2013 and ETH Zurich in 2014. In addition, he was with the ABB Corporate Research Center, Switzerland, in 2009. In recognition of his contributions, Dr. Wang received the Richard M. Bass Outstanding Young Power Electronics Engineer Award from the IEEE Power Electronics Society in 2016. Furthermore, he was Chair of the IEEE IAS/IES/PELS Chapter in Denmark from 2018 to 2020.

                    <b>Abstract</b>
                    <p>Power electronic converters are applied almost everywhere today when electricity is generated, transmitted, converted, or utilized, from mobile phones to electric vehicles, from renewable energy generation to industrial manufacturing. Condition monitoring is a proactive measure to realize operation optimization, predictive maintenance, and high availability of power electronic systems. In the data era, new possibilities are emerging with the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data analytics tools. Combined with increasing data accumulation of power electronic systems, it provides an unprecedented opportunity and establishes a solid foundation to enable data-informed condition monitoring solutions. This tutorial will cover the following three aspects: 1) brief introduction to the application of power electronics to power systems; 2) trends in applying AI and data analytics in power electronics, including the condition and health monitoring; 3) case studies.
