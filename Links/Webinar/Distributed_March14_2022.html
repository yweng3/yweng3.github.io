                    <b>Abstract</b>
                    <p>With increasing penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in grid edge including renewable generation, flexible loads, and storage, it is becoming increasingly important to carry out accurate prediction as well as optimization of distributed generation and consumption. However, systems-centric tasks such as prediction and optimization require data to be communicated, either repeatedly or in large amounts, for accurate and reliable performance. This introduces a challenge in the form of compromises of privacy. With growing presence of DER, owners and stakeholders also increase in number, which underscores the need for ensuring grid performance with privacy preservation. Such privacy preservation is also of interest in the context of retail electricity markets as any optimal market designs should be realized without revealing sensitive information. This talk will address these three systems concepts, of distributed optimization, DER prediction, and privacy preservation. Two methods will be discussed in detail, that will seek to realize the first two properties without compromising the third. The first is a distributed optimization approach based on Proximal Atomic Coordination, which has been implemented in a market context and allows sensitive information to be protected. The second is a distributed machine learning approach, Federated Learning, which has a potential of carrying out DER forecasting using a network of IoT nodes. The talk will encompass theoretical properties of these methods as well as their application to grid specific objectives including economic dispatch in local electricity markets, voltage control, ramp management in duck curves, and load swings. Use case studies include modified IEEE-123 buses with high penetration of DER and realistic load profiles such as the Pecan street dataset.
