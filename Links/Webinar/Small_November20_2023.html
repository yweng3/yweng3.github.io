                    <b>Abstract</b>
                    <p>The transformation of energy structure has brought multiple uncertainties to the smart grid, such as uncertainty in distributed power generation, behavior of stakeholders, and interactive data information, etc. The dynamic changes in the operational architecture and topology of the power grid make it difficult to timely detect potential operational risks, which calls for higher requirements for situational awareness ability of smart grid. However, in the multi-uncertain environment, the smart grid situational awareness is faced with the analysis demand of real-time high-quality big data and the practical problem of obtaining limited low-quality small data. The actual data is missing, abnormal or insufficient in unknown or special operating scenarios, which lead the perception accuracy and reliability of data-driven based situational awareness methods to decline significantly, making it unable to support operational scheduling decisions. While upgrading measurement sensing systems on a large scale and establishing data centers can also bring economic issues and high energy consumption. Therefore, small data analytics based situational awareness has important practical engineering value. Starting from analyzing the small data characteristic of situational awareness of the smart grid, this talk preliminarily explores the idea of solving small data situational awareness from three perspectives of data enhancement, transfer learning, and hybrid data model-driven, summarizes the existing research cases respectively, in order to provide useful references for the research and development of small data analytics for enhanced situational awareness of the smart grid.
