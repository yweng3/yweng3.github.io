                    <b>Abstract</b>
                    <p>Contemporary power grid system operators require new tools to process a large volume of smart sensor data real-time to gain situational awareness and improve the decision-making process in the power system's operation. Digitalization of energy Systems allow utilities to monitor the system in real-time at different time scales. The use of such smart sensor technologies has opened opportunities to introduce novel tools to enhance the power grid's comprehension of the system. Motivated by these challenges, several innovative data Mining solutions for transmission/distribution systems are presented. In particular, empathized with its potential applications to the Mexican power grid. Results regarding low-frequency oscillation monitoring and user-consumption energy data analysis are presented in detail to illustrate the complex needs that face the power grid operator.

                        <b>Q & A</b>
                        <p><strong>Q</strong>: What should I do if your slide is frozen or there is an Internet connection problem?<br>
<strong>A</strong>: Just let me know right on the shut or interrupt me.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q</strong>: What is the emerging view in Europe regarding the energy sector and other sectors?<br>
<strong>A</strong>: The view is that other sectors are continuously integrating with the smart grid infrastructures to fully exploit the flexibility from other sectors' data. There is a reference architecture showing the interaction between the energy sector and others, with data management platforms in between involving various tools and different data governance models and roles. Also, the common European data space is emerging as a technical infrastructure where data is shared among different entities in multiple sectors like healthcare, agriculture, finance, culture, and especially in the energy sector as well.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q</strong>: Could you give some examples of cross sector services?<br>
<strong>A</strong>: One example is using the local collection of smart meters to generate alarms for healthcare services. For instance, for vulnerable people alone at home, if there is a change in energy consumption, an alarm can be generated for a caretaker. Another example is in building renovation and comfort. Data about energy consumption and comfort can be used to better define the actions for building renovation and also for financing the renovation.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q</strong>: What are the eight use cases you will cover in the presentation and what challenges might be involved?<br>
<strong>A</strong>: The eight use cases include three renewable energy use cases, three control room and grid operation use cases, and two community-level use cases. In some cases, there are scenarios with data scarcity or privacy barriers, which is quite common in Europe. For example, there are strict data protection regulations on personal data sharing and the emerging AI Act has demanding requirements on AI algorithm transparency and security that will impact the research landscape.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q</strong>: Could you explain the work on renewable energy forecasting?<br>
<strong>A</strong>: For renewable energy forecasting, for example, around photovoltaic and wind power plants, there are a large number of variables from numerical weather predictions. Through feature engineering, key features are extracted from these variables (like creating time standard deviation, average of past forecasts, spatial average, etc.), reducing the number of variables from thousands to about 20 for each plant type. Using these engineered features in models like gradient boosting tree improves the forecasting accuracy, including narrowing the prediction interval size, improving point prediction and uncertainty prediction. This work has been integrated into some commercial forecasting systems and influenced other companies doing prediction work.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q</strong>: How do you solve the data privacy problem when combining data from different photovoltaic or wind sites for prediction?<br>
<strong>A</strong>: A privacy-preserving protocol or federated learning protocol was developed. It uses a data encryption power matrix built by agents (each agent only knows its own matrix) and a random matrix to encrypt coefficients. Through the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM) for distributed computing, encrypted coefficients are obtained, and each agent owns a part of the key to get the original coefficients, making the model fitting robust against data leakage in terms of privacy. It has been applied to 60 wind turbines in 30 wind power plants in France and shown improvement compared to other methods in some cases while ensuring data privacy.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q</strong>: What are the data market frameworks and data sharing incentives you are working on?<br>
<strong>A</strong>: There are three frameworks being studied: data for money (the revenue from providing data depends on how much it improves the forecasting skills, and there are challenges in fairly distributing the gains and determining the offers), data for data (provide data and receive data of similar value, measured by mutual information, correlation, etc.), data for recognition (providing data for the common good can get recognition, like for better operation of PV systems helping to reduce emissions). For the data for money framework, an algorithm solution for operating the data market was developed where agents make offers with minimum and maximum prices and value functions, and the market is dispatched to maximize social welfare and get a common price for data exchange.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q</strong>: How do you handle renewable energy trading decisions and deal with model complexity and interpretability?<br>
<strong>A</strong>: Traditionally, having multiple models for different aspects like price prediction and renewable energy prediction leads to complexity and lack of interpretability for human traders. Now, the approach is to have a single prescriptive model that uses inputs like weather predictions and observations and directly outputs trading decisions. Instead of using post hoc interpretability techniques for black box models like neural networks, a symbolic model with equations and rules (sometimes built using genetic programming) is developed so that human traders can understand, modify and incorporate their own knowledge into it.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q</strong>: Could you introduce the digital twin related to the operation and maintenance of photovoltaic power plants?<br>
<strong>A</strong>: In a project, a digital twin was created with a particular emphasis on the inverter which often causes availability problems in PV power plants. Using the digital twin, synthetic data and real data were generated, and feature engineering was carried out to create variables. These were input into a machine learning pipeline to classify five different types of faults in the inverter. The method achieved high accuracy, and when there is an availability problem with the inverter in the PV plant, the type of fault can be quickly determined. Currently, work is being done on locating the exact position of the fault in large PV parks.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q</strong>: How do you handle a large number of alarm messages in the control room environment?<br>
<strong>A</strong>: Data representation is very important. Different methods have been explored, such as TF - IDF (easy to implement but has the limitation of not considering the alarm sequence), word embeddings (captures the sequence but is computationally intensive), and graph-based representation (visually shows the transitions between different stages of events and can be used as input for machine learning to classify fault types). There are also applications like identifying normal protection behaviors and providing suggestions to operators on which reclosures to operate to restore power more quickly.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q</strong>: How do you classify events based on PMU data?<br>
<strong>A</strong>: Using PMU data collected from Brazil and South America (with 60 measurements per second), events like crawling, tripping, oscillation, etc. are represented as a frame to summarize the data and visually distinguish different types of events. Combining this representation with convolutional neural networks and using real data from large real systems achieved 100% event classification accuracy.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q</strong>: Could you explain the secondary forecast for congestion prediction and its application?<br>
<strong>A</strong>: Secondary forecast (forecast of the forecast) for congestion prediction is done to help decide whether to reserve flexible resources now or wait for subsequent forecasts. Based on this, risk cost curves are built to make decisions considering that uncertainty decreases over time but the price of flexibility may increase as the modification time shortens. Feature engineering was carried out and different models were tested. Compared with the baseline model, an improvement of 13% to 31% was achieved, and it can save flexibility costs for system operators.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q</strong>: How do you use smart meter data for causal analysis?<br>
<strong>A</strong>: Smart meter data is used for causal analysis to estimate consumer elasticity (which is important for electricity retail companies to design tariffs or measure the performance of demand response plans) and rank consumers according to their elasticity. Besides price signals (like time-of-use tariffs), other explanatory variables like weather conditions, indoor temperature, day of the week, etc. are also used. The results show different consumers have different elasticity levels under different price tariffs and also help determine which consumers are more responsive in demand response plans.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q</strong>: How do you use smart meter data to estimate the operating conditions of the low-voltage grid?<br>
<strong>A</strong>: Both historical data of smart meters and data from some smart meters with real-time communication are used. By observing the information of real-time meters and other variables, and looking at past data and picking relevant data for similar analysis. A smoothing process is involved and tests were carried out in different low-voltage grids. With only 10% of the meters having real-time communication, accurate results for voltage and active power were obtained. Also, a variable coefficient regression model was used to handle the problem that sensitivity changes with grid operating conditions, and a privacy protocol was applied to handle smart meter data which is regarded as personal data.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q</strong>: What are the impacts of model complexity in big data and machine learning and what aspects should be considered?<br>
<strong>A</strong>: Models are becoming more complex with the combination of long short-term networks, attention layers and transformers. There are questions about whether the performance is really improving and whether the industry is adopting them. Also, due to the AI Act in Europe, aspects like interpretability and transparency need to be considered. Incentive mechanisms for data sharing need to be created, and human-AI cooperation should be advanced. Additionally, the challenge of communicating predictions and certainty to humans should be addressed. There are also two new European projects starting and recruiting students and postdocs, one related to applying AI to critical infrastructures and cooperating with humans, and the other being a lighthouse project for green AI research applied to the energy sector.<br>
