                    <b>Abstract</b>
                    <p>Many countries have set a goal to achieve 100% clean energy by 2035. This will spur integration of a large amount of renewable systems and operation of microgrid at all levels. To cope with the operational variability and uncertainty in those systems, new control technologies and energy management systems for maintaining system frequency and voltage are required. However, the development of those technologies requires the modeling of a wide variety of new topologies and unseen operating conditions in realistic simulated environments. In the past, only a limited number of IEEE test systems or typical feeder models are available. The data sets are often times snapshots in a small range of operation conditions. This will not be sufficient for meeting the increasing need for the development of high-fidelity power distribution grid digital-twins that can replay actual system operations and mimic its evolution when different control strategies are applied. In the past few years, we have been focusing on developing machine learning–based methods to automate and expedite the development of power system digital twins. In this tutorial, we are going to introduce the technical details of a few ML-based algorithms developed for such purposes: GAN-based synthetic network topology and load profile generation, meta-learning based load forecasting, and GAN-based super-resolution tool for producing high-resolution data sets. The challenges and opportunities emerging in this research area will also be discussed.
