                    <b>Abstract</b>
                    <p>With increased uncertainties and rapidly changing operational conditions in power systems, existing stability control methods and operation paradigms have outstanding issues in terms of either speed, adaptiveness, or scalability. Recent years have seen notable progress in AI and learning-based control methods such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for solving challenging control and decision-making problems across many domains such as games, robotics and power systems. However, existing methods have scalability, adaptability, and security issues. To address these challenges, an integrated framework based on the idea of Convergence of AI, Physics, Computing, and Control is developed and employed in the ARPA-E HADREC project,. On top of it, scalable, physics-informed DRL algorithms and high-performance computational tools are developed to achieve intelligent stability control for large-scale power systems. We will talk about its integration with V&R â€™ s commercial tools and show test results on large-scale power systems. Finally, we will discuss the potential of this framework, when combined with new hardware and software platform, for transforming the grid operation and control from the control rooms to the grid edge.
