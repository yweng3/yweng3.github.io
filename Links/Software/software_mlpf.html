            The increasing distributed energy resources (DERs)
            integration calls for new monitoring and operational planning
            tools to ensure stability and sustainability in distribution grids.
            One idea is to use existing monitoring tools in transmission
            grids and some primary distribution grids. However, they usually
            depend on the knowledge of the system model, e.g., the topology
            and line parameters, which may be unavailable in primary and
            secondary distribution grids. Furthermore, a utility usually has
            limited modeling ability of active controllers for solar panels as
            they may belong to a third party like residential customers. To
            solve the modeling problem in traditional power flow analysis,
            we propose a data-driven approach to reveal the mapping rules
            between different variables and recover useful variables based
            on physical understanding and data mining. Specifically, we
            illustrate how to use our machine learning tool to conduct 1) system
            monitoring with asynchronous measurements in distribution
            grid with DER and 2) short-term prediction of potential voltage
            violation for operational planning. The superior performance
            of our method is demonstrated numerically by comparing our
            proposed method with other methods.
            This software is being validated and adopted by <a href="https://www.sce.com/">South California Edison</a> Data.
