                    <p>In light of events threatening global security such as the war that began between Israel and Hamas on Oct. 7, the need to secure vital resources such as electricity, water and fuels is more essential than ever.</p>
<p>To bolster cyberdefense for energy grids and water systems, the U.S. and Israel began a collaboration known as the Israel-U.S. Initiative on Cybersecurity Research and Development for Energy, or ICRDE, which is one of four consortia operating under the administration of the</p>
<p>The collaboration, which began in 2021, includes a variety of academic and industry partners, Arizona State University leads the coalition’s U.S. efforts, while Ben-Gurion University of the Negev leads the Israeli side.</p>
<p>The coalition has pursued research to improve energy grid cybersecurity since 2021 and met at four virtual conference workshops. The fifth workshop, held in Tempe, Arizona, at the <a href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/arizona/hyatt-place-tempe-phoenix-university/phxzt?src=corp_lclb_gmb_seo_phxzt">Hyatt Place</a> hotel near ASU’s Tempe campus from Oct. 9–11, was the first to take place in person due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The workshops give coalition members a chance to network with one another, discuss the ICRDE’s future plans and share updates on their research progress. The ICRDE’s work has even been noticed beyond the coalition, leading the Tempe workshop to include organizations outside of coalition partners, such as those from the <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> and Stanford University.</p>
<p>“The workshop shows a common interest related to my research field,” says <a href="https://search.asu.edu/profile/917711">Yang Weng</a>, an assistant professor of electrical engineering in the <a href="https://engineering.asu.edu/">Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering</a> at ASU and leader of the ICRDE’s U.S. side. “In the workshop, we bring distinct ideas to the consortium based on our research and products.”</p>
<p><strong>Discovering new defenses for energy resources</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Kyle Squires, dean of the Fulton Schools and vice provost of engineering, computing and technology, gave an overview of ASU as an institution and what the university stands for.</p>
<p>“ASU is No. 1 in innovation, and it’s been that way now for eight years running,” Squires said in his speech. “When you’re around the place and you’re working with our faculty and students, you really begin to get a sense of what that’s like.”</p>
<p>A written message from Tal Fischelovitch, the BIRD Foundation’s ICRDE director of partnerships, encouraged those involved in the coalition to build connections with one another and take advantage of the opportunity to meet in person.</p>
<p>The keynote speaker for the day, Gideon Friedmann, a chief scientist at the <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/departments/ministry_of_energy/govil-landing-page">Israel Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure</a>, spoke on the challenges presented by the transition to renewable energy resources and related cybersecurity issues.</p>
<p>Friedmann discussed the potential and current state of various technologies for carbon emission reduction, including hydrogen fuel, carbon capture, geothermal energy, solar technology and nuclear power. He also discussed how the <a href="https://www.smartgrid.gov/the_smart_grid/smart_grid.html">smart grid</a> will change energy markets for electricity and the cybersecurity challenges the energy grid faces.</p>
<p>Friedmann said one of the biggest challenges to cybersecurity for renewable energy is the change from a few central sources of power generation to many smaller ones.</p>
<p>“You have millions of nodes, of course, and a very complicated connection system, and many of them will be run by people who are not experts in any way, similarly to how everyone has their own computer,” he said. “Most users have no idea about cyber[security]. This is, in some sense, risky, but in other senses, it’s also resilient because the system is more diverse.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://events.engineering.asu.edu/bird-icrde/agenda/">conference agenda</a> included presentations on new developments in the consortium’s research topics, such as projects in modeling and monitoring of energy systems and tools for learning and detection of cyberattacks on information technology and operational technology architecture. ASU presenters included Weng, <a href="https://search.asu.edu/profile/1981673">Lalitha Sankar</a>, a professor of electrical engineering in the Fulton Schools, and <a href="https://search.asu.edu/profile/1888769">Joel Mathias</a>, an electrical engineering postdoctoral research scholar.</p>
<p>The day also included discussions of the ICRDE’s future such as the potential to extend the consortium’s activities, funding and possible new research ideas, including one by <a href="https://search.asu.edu/profile/280227">Ying-Cheng Lai</a>, an ASU Regents Professor of electrical engineering, to use advanced machine learning techniques to detect and defend against cyberattacks on the energy grid.</p>
<p>The workshop’s first day finished with two poster presentation sessions, a mariachi music performance and a review of work on ICRDE projects.</p>
<p><strong>Contemplating cybersecurity to defend the energy grid</strong></p>
<p>The second day began with a keynote speech from Jared Bierbach, a senior international relations officer for the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/">U.S. Department of Energy</a>. Bierbach praised the ICRDE as an effective example of industry and academic collaboration across consortium members from both countries.</p>
<p>“Although it’s been around for just a few years, many people are looking to the model of the energy center to advance technology and bring together leaders and academia, research institutions and industry to solve complex problems,” he said.</p>
<p>Bierbach explained his role in the Department of Energy’s <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ia/office-international-affairs">Office of International Affairs</a> and some of the workings of the Department of Energy. He emphasized the importance of cybersecurity and the ICRDE’s work in furthering the Biden administration’s climate goals.</p>
<p>The day’s agenda included meetings with cybersecurity experts from industry, a simulation and security assessment of <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/industrial-control-system">industrial control systems</a>, panel discussions on attack detection and mitigation and security assessment and information sharing, meetings about business opportunities and the ICRDE’s future, demonstrations of cybersecurity tools developed by industry, a research poster presentation session and a tour of Weng’s lab.</p>
<p><strong>Closing out a collaborative workshop</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://search.asu.edu/profile/547474">Stephen Phillips</a>, professor of electrical engineering and director of the <a href="https://ecee.engineering.asu.edu/">School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering</a>, part of the Fulton Schools, opened the final day by giving an overview of funding and explaining where support for the ICRDE comes from in various organizations within the university.</p>
<p>“There is a commitment from the entire university toward the success of this project,” Phillips said.</p>
<p>The first presentation session of the day was about tools for control and mitigation of threats for achieving resilience. ASU’s Lai was among those presenting, explaining his findings on the use of heterogeneous reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning, for the defense of large power grids and the technology’s potential commercialization.</p>
<p>A final session on cybersecurity designs to defend against future threats included Weng’s research on hardware-in-the-loop technology, which tests algorithms by running them in a virtual environment designed to simulate real-world conditions.</p>
<p>For Weng, the workshop represents meaningful progress toward solving energy grid security issues around the world.</p>
<p>“I am glad to bring people together to tackle the cybersecurity problem for energy systems,” he says. “I hope that ASU can continue its leadership in power and energy research and improve energy services for people worldwide.”</p>
