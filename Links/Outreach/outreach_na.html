            <p>
            Arizona has a rich Native American history and culture, and is home to the third-largest population of Native Americans
            at about 296,732 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010) with a total of 22 tribal nations [1,2,3]. In grades 3 to 12, 
            Native American (NA) students comprised approximately 5% of the total student enrollment at Arizona public schools 
            in FY17 [3]. Maricopa County, where ASU is located, has the largest number of grade 3 to 12 NA students in 
            Arizona. Therefore, Yang initiates the How Your Ancestors Used AI program to take advantage of the 
            interdisciplinary and visual properties of the proposed research in machine learning, offering an excellent opportunity to 
            establish a convincing connection between the wisdom from ancestors and the cutting edge research that can 
            potentially be applied to every aspect of our present life [4]. In the long-term, this project can also help 
            reduce the dropout rate of Native Americans [5] by engaging students in STEM educational activities that are 
            culturally responsive [6].
            </p>

            <p>Preliminary Activities. Yang has collaborated with ASU American Indian Initiatives and conducted a 
            discussion followed by a lab tour for Native Americans students from 22 tribes. In the discussion, Yang explained to the students 
            how the Salt River flooding used to cause remarkable destruction to the Native American land. To mitigate the 
            damage, their ancestors designed the irrigation system to deal with the rain and flood patterns. Yang further 
            explained how their ancestors developed the irrigation system is a form of AI using a standard data collection and 
            data mining process. The students then engaged in a hands-on experience with a cutting edge big data platform, in 
            which they drew a simple statistical analysis of the geographical system near their tribe lands using geographical 
            data for solar generation in Arizona. The exercise successfully stimulated students' interest. Yang then 
            switched the topic from software to hardware. The PI showed the students how four solar-electric vehicle robots 
            interact with each other to locate a charging station at a low price. Finally, Yang's sophomore 
            student, Dinesh Silva, discussed with the students on his experience for joining a research team.
